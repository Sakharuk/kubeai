| app.yaml                    | Generate only the YAML manifest for a Kubernetes Pod named app in the demo namespace. The container should use image gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0, be named app, and expose port 8000 with the name http. The Pod should have two labels: app=demo and run=demo.

The container should be named app and use image gcr.io/smartcity-gl/demo:v1.0.1. Expose port 8080 named http. Add a liveness probe that sends an HTTP GET to path / on port 8000, with initialDelaySeconds 5, timeoutSeconds 1, periodSeconds 10, and failureThreshold 3.
